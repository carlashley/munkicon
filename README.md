This is a collection of conditional items scripts for munki that can also be used for "on device" conditions that might be beneficial in other deployment systems.

## DISCLAIMER
This is experimental and provided _as is_ with no warranty, or guaranteed support.

Please test that this works for you in your environment.

*Note - 2022-02-22: Some of the conditions generated by this script do not work unless run by a user from the command line with `sudo`.* 

## Building a package
After cloning, run `./build.sh` and provide a password for `sudo` when prompted.

The resulting package is generated in `./dist/pkg/`.

*Note* if you need to deploy this with a specific Python shebang, such as the munki `/usr/local/munki/munki-python`, simply build with the path as the only argument:
```
./build.sh /usr/local/munki/munki-python
```

## Conditions not generated when running Managed Software Center
Depending on the macOS version, some conditions may not be returned when running Managed Software Center interactively.
- System Extensions
- TCC/PPPCP

These conditions should not be relied upon unless `managedsoftwareupdate` is being run interactively at the command line with elevated privileges (as `root`).
These conditions are considered deprecated and will be removed in a future update sometime after 2021-12-21 AEST.

## Binaries
All binaries called by the processors exist in macOS 10.15.7+. No intention to make these backwards compatible with older macOS versions.


## Usage
`munkicon` can be dropped directly into the munki conditions folder (`/usr/local/munki/conditions/`), however the prebuilt package installs the `munkicon` processor to `/usr/local/bin/munkicon` by default.

It is recommended to use a shell script in the munki conditions folder that calls `munkicon`. This will provide flexibility in running all processors (no command line flags, or just run specific processors).

For example, to run all processors:
```
/usr/local/bin/munkicon
```

To run specific processors (see Command Line Arguments below for usage):
```
/usr/local/bin/munkicon --kexts --user-accts --system-setup
```

### Command line arguments
